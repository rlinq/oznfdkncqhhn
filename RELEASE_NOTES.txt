    CCA for Splunk's user interface is a helper function that assists in creating and execute the
    ansible-playbook commands for a give playbook and host selection. It gives full control
    to see and select target hosts. Each ansible playbook has a set of configurable arguments,
    on the page with extra vars, additional variables are listed with their default values.

    You will be guided through playbook selection, host limits and options to configure the
    additional variables.

               your local CCA infrastructure and onboarding repo to git. Then check file contents
               against cca_for_splunk/templates files and update where needed.


               Bug fixes:
                  * Updated splunk_login.yml task to handle forced splunkd restart. Useful when
                    a config error that prevented splunkd to start has been fixed but splunkd
                    restart has not been triggered.
                  * Corrected onboarding variable names in cca.splunk.onboarding tasks.

                    password for the c2 to c8 index and search head cluster. Re-run the setup to
                    produce new random pass4SymmKeys.
                  * Updated env variables to not quote stings for paths as it prevented shell expansions.
                  * Fixed scroll text option in cca_ctrl playbook selection.
                  * Added `connection: local` when `delegate_to: localhost` is used on the manager server as that
                    connection is for localhost.
                  * Changed instruction to store splunk binaries for setup_wizard in /var/tmp/
                  * Corrected logic in manage_searchhead_clusters.yml that prevented SH Cluster C2-> to run.
                  * Changed variables to track multiple Search Head Cluster captain init status during

                * Changed to linear strategy in configure_linux_servers.yml playbook.
                * Removed splunk start from manage_searchhead_clusters.yml. Caused race

                * Updated roles/*/meta/main.yml to correct meta information that was missing.
                * Renamed variable for rolling peer restart retries, new variable is

                  restart phase.
                * Updated cca.splunk.onboarding/README.md to match directory structure
                  in data onboarding repo.
                * cca_ctrl - fix scroll function to be able to read release notes in the UI.
                * Increased timeout for initial start of Splunk from 120 to 180 seconds to
                  handle lab environments with lower specs.
                * General correction of spelling errors.

    2022.2.3 Set current Splunk Enterprise version so that group_vars files can use it.
             Updated deployment_server group_vars file, if current Splunk Enterprise
             version is below 9.0.0, disable deployment server functionallity.

             Bug fixes:
                * Corrected splunk_conf_group_settings variable in
                  templates/infrastructure_template/environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/group_vars/
                  for
                     all_in_one_servers
	             data_collection_nodes
	             deployment_servers
	             forwarders
	             hybrid_searchheads
                  Important: Copy these files to your environments/ENVIRONMENT_NAME/group_vars
                             folder if you have already run the setup. If not, you don't need to
                             do anything.

    2022.2.2 Playbooks to manage Splunk Enterprise upgrades and CVE info
             Splunk Deployment Servers with a versions earlier than 9.0 has
             the following CVE-2022-32158, CVSSv3.1 Score: 9.0, Critical
             https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security/announcements/svd-2022-0608.html

             To upgrade just the Splunk Deployment Servers, add an explicit version in the
             hosts inventory file.
             [deployment_servers:vars]
             splunk_enterprise_version='9.0.0'

             Store the tgz file in the infrastructure repo at splunk/var/images.

             Run ./cca_ctrl and select the playbook upgrade_non_clustered_splunk_servers.yml
             and target only the Deployment Servers. Perform the upgrade in a test environment
             before doing so in Production.

             Playbooks added:
                rolling_upgrade_splunk_clusters.yml
                upgrade_non_clustered_splunk_servers.yml

             Bug fixes:
                * Corrected path for splunk in task ensure_splunk_version.yml
                * Removed manifest files from diff cleanup files, manifest files
                  are a great source of information to get insight on the historical
                  upgrade path of an Splunk Server
                * Shorten menu description for configure_linux_servers.yml
